## TODO.md Maintenance

**RULE:** All agents MUST maintain TODO.md when working on this project.

### When to Update TODO.md

**ALWAYS update TODO.md when:**
- ✅ Completing a task (move to Recently Completed)
- ✅ Finding a new bug or issue (add to Known Issues)
- ✅ Starting new work (add to appropriate Priority section)
- ✅ Making architectural decisions (document in relevant sections)
- ✅ Adding technical debt (document in Technical Debt section)

**HOW to update:**
1. Mark completed tasks with ✅ and move to "Recently Completed"
2. Add new tasks to appropriate priority section (🔴 High / 🟡 Medium / 🟢 Low)
3. Update "Last Updated" timestamp at bottom
4. Keep descriptions concise but informative
5. Include dates and context for decisions

**WHAT to track:**
- Bugs and issues (even if not yet fixed)
- Architectural decisions and rationale
- Technical debt as it's introduced
- Future improvement ideas
- Blockers and dependencies

**NEVER:**
- Remove items without completing them
- Leave completed items in priority sections
- Let the file become stale (> 1 week without update)
- Make changes without updating relevant sections

This TODO.md serves as the single source of truth for project status and future work.
